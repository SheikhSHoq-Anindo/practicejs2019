# practicejs2019
This is basically me fiddling around with java script.
I tried to create a keypad and a terminal of sorts to display the result of the input code.
I have not reached what I had wished for yet I have encountered bugs and unexpected behaviour which I have no clue of what, why and how.
This is my first attempt at writing jscript file and I am no coder nor computer engineer or expert.
So despite its really nothing and useless, I feel very proud that a person of my calbre actually pulled this off.
If you find any glitches or bugs let me know, and if you know any improvement of any kind that can be done over this, let me know as well.
Wish me luck.
Thank you if you have visited the page.
